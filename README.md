# Matteo's Personal Website (https://sandr.in)

This repository holds the templates and assets for my personal website. There is
a Makefile in the root of this repository that contains all the commands needed
to build the tempalates and assets into a static website.

To build this website, run the `make build` command. This command will:

1. Install Python dependencies
2. Copy over static assets
3. Build Jinja templates to HTML
4. Build Tailwind classes to CSS
