  <p>
    I'm a software engineer on the Google Ads team, focused on hotels. My work
    revolves around building reporting features that help hotel advertisers
    understand their ad performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    I get to work on possibly the largest data pipeline in the world, processing
    billions of clicks, views and conversions per second. I also get to learn
    from some of the most accomplished software engineers in the industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my key accomplishments is designing and implementing a feature that
    provides advertisers with a clear view of their ad campaigns in different
    hotel destination markets. This feature allows advertisers to easily
    identify which destinations are not performing well, and optimize their
    campaings accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that, I interned on the Google Flights team. Over the course of a
    summer, I and a scrappy band of interns redesigned and rewrote from scratch
    the frontend of the
    <a href="https://matrix.itasoftware.com" class="link" target="_blank">
      Matrix</a> 
    flight search engine. This search engine has a loyal following of over
    200,000 flight enthusiasts.

  <p>
    Smartcar's core product is an API to remotely control any vehicle. Think
    lock, unlock, climate control, windows, etc. I reverse-engineered the
    Chrysler and Volkswagen Android apps, in order to figure out their APIs and
    integrate them into the core product. I spent many hours in the sunny office
    parking lot, remotely poking and prodding Smartcar's fleet of test cars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smartcar was a small company at the time, no more than 15 employees. I
    enjoyed the challenge of working at an early-stage startup, doing everything
    from code to design to hosting a hackathon. I learned more in those three
    months about software engineering that I ever had before, and made some
    lifelong friends along the way.
