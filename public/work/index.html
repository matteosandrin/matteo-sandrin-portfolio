          I work as a software engineer on the Hotel Ads team. The features I
          built allow hotel owners to understand how to improve their ad
          campaigns. I get to work on the complex plumbing that follows a click
          on google.com all the through the Ads infrastructure.

          Before that, I worked as an intern on the Flights team. I worked on
          rewriting from scratch the frontend of matrix.itasoftware.com. The
          Matrix flight search engine has a loyal following of over 200,000
          users.
