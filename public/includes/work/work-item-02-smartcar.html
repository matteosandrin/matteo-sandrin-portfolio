    Smartcar's core product is an API to remotely control any vehicle. Think
    lock, unlock, climate control, windows, etc. I worked on reverse-engineering
    the android apps of car manufacturers, in order to get integrate their APIs
    the core product. I spent many fun hours in the office parking lot, remotely
    controlling Smartcar's fleet of test cars.
