    I work as a software engineer on the Hotel Ads team. The features I built
    allow hotel owners to understand how to improve their ad campaigns. I get to
    work on the complex plumbing that follows a click on google.com all the
    through the Ads infrastructure.

    Before that, I worked as an intern on the Flights team. I worked on
    rewriting from scratch the frontend of matrix.itasoftware.com. The Matrix
    flight search engine has a loyal following of over 200,000 users.
