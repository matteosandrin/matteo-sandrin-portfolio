  <p>
    The display shows a real-time view of the incoming trains at the Harvard
    MBTA train stop. It's powered by five 32x32 dot matrix LED displays
    daisy-chained together and controlled by an ESP32. The MBTA font was
    faithfully re-created pixel-by-pixel from hundreds of reference pictures,
    along with the specific copy and timing of announcements. The final product
    is an exact and functional replica of the MBTA's arrival board. The display
    can alternatively show currently playing songs and album art from Spotify.
