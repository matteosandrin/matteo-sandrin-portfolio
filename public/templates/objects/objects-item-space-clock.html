    This object began its life as a General Electric model F1-8147 bedside alarm
    clock. When I found it on the shelves of a thrift store, I was struck by the
    space age look of its vacuum-fluorescent display and by the boxy 80s
    silhouette of it shell. Inspiration struck: this clock was destined for
    space. I pictured it at ease on the dashboard of the
    <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZoSYsNADtY?t=91" target="_blank" class="link">
        Pan-American Lunar Shuttle
    </a>, from the film "2001: A Space Odyssey".

    To bring this vision to life, the clock is stripped down to its bare
    components. Every button is cleaned and resoldered. The shell is sanded,
    primed and painted a lunar shade of white. The iconic NASA logo is carefully
    applied to both sides, while the alarm control switch is painted a vibrant
    red to match. Finally, the display rim and raised labeling are touched up
    for contrast.

    The result is an artifact with both futuristic elements and timeless charm,
    poised for its celestial journey into the depths of outer space.
